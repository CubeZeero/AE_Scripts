This is a collection of scripts for After Effects that I have developed.

## AutoGuide

It is a script that can create a guide with one click.

You can also create by specifying the number of divisions.

Rename the input string to the layer name one character at a time.

## Simple-Blink

Assign it to a keyboard shortcut etc...

## SpotifyCtrl

This is a script to control Spotify from AfterEffects.

It is hosted by a command line tool created in Python.
